# CyberHack 2025 (Competition)

## **Project Name:** Dark Web Surveillance: Identifying Child Exploitation Offenders
**Team Name:** Dark Slayer  

## **Problem Statement**
The dark web is widely misused for illicit activities, including the distribution of child pornography. The anonymous nature of the Tor network makes it difficult for authorities to track offenders. Our project, **Project_CyberHack**, provides a **technical solution** to scan the dark web, identify individuals uploading such content, and extract their personal details (name, address, mobile number, etc.).
